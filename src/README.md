# Creode Tech Test - Social Media API's

## Introduction

You should not spend longer than a few hours developing code and don’t worry if you don’t manage to complete it, just send over what you have. We’d like to see your solution with well thought out, clean code focusing on readability and reusability.

## Brief

The aim is to produce a webpage which displays a list of friends/followers. These should be retrieved from the mock API classes provided. The product must be as adaptable as possible for future requirements, for example the implementation of additional API classes. The code should be formatted and organised as simply as possible and repeated code should be avoided.

### CBook API Mock Library
The CBook API uses an approach which requires:

 - A client_id (**`8XWr1Hp5xbhSM6u0`**)
 - A client_secret (**`07xdHM9OA8ULaBeC`**)

### Critter API Mock Library
The Critter API requires just an API key for authentication:

 - An API Key (**`j4nHNuaPo2nq6AdW`**)

### Outputting the Response
The final output of this implementation will be a page showing the following data:

 - Follower/Friend Name
 - Follower/Friend Photo
 - Follower/Friend Description
 - Follower/Friend Count
 - Follower/Friend Email Address

## Deliverables

 - A brief write-up of any decisions you made (and why!) and details of any bits you didn't manage to add but you'd like to.
 - Any instructions to get the code running.
 - An archived git repository showing commit history.

All the deliverables should be emailed to guy.weston@creode.co.uk once you have finished.
